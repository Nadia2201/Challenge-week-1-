# Challenge-week-1-
This week challenge is an on-the-job ticket, I have been given a starter code and I need to refactor it.


## Description
A marketing agency has hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible and ensure that people with disabilities can access the website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards.
I have to rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.

## Installation
